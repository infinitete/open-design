 * This is a deliberate structural subset of the daemon/web
 * `WorkspaceCollabContext`, redeclared here rather than imported: this package
 * is the renderer host-bridge wire contract and must stay independent of the
 * daemon/web contracts package (enforced by the "stays independent from
 * daemon/web contracts" test). A full `WorkspaceCollabContext` is structurally
 * assignable to this type, so callers pass theirs unchanged.
 *
 * Only the fields the host actually forwards are modelled, and the enum-like
 * fields stay `string` because the host treats them as opaque pass-through
 * values — the daemon remains the authority that parses and validates them.
 * Deliberately no index signature: an interface never satisfies one, so adding
 * it would reject the very `WorkspaceCollabContext` callers pass. Callers hand
 * over a variable, not a fresh literal, so the extra fields ride along fine.
